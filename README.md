The flood viewer was created to investigate where the Green Bay dike is most vulnerable to breaches and how those breaches might impact communities within the City. Water levels depicted in the map were chosen with the help of University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institue and are based on historic water levels and historic storm surges. Flooded areas were extracted from elevation data and are an estimate of where flooding would occur.
